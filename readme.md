# Langchain, OpenAI, Pinecon, WeatherAPI

Langchain is an innovative technology developed by OpenAI that aims to understand and process natural language effectively. It leverages advanced language models, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), to provide powerful language processing capabilities. By utilizing deep learning techniques, Langchain can analyze and generate human-like text, enabling a wide range of applications such as language translation, chatbots, and content generation. OpenAI's Langchain represents a significant breakthrough in natural language processing, facilitating more sophisticated and context-aware interactions with textual data.

## Installation

Use the link to download python [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) & install python.

```bash
py --version
```

```bash
pip --version
```

```bash
py get-pip.py
```

### If facing problem to recognize 'pip' command

##### Run the following command to check if the Python Scripts directory is already included in the PATH variable:

```bash
$env:Path -split ';'
```

##### Run the following command to add the Python Scripts directory to the PATH variable:

```bash
$env:Path += ";C:\PythonXX\Scripts"
```

##### Verify that the Python Scripts directory is now included in the PATH variable by running the command again:

```bash
$env:Path -split ';'
```

```bash
pip install streamlit langchain openai
```

##### run app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

```bash
